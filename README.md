Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
My Client was Artemis Financial, a financial company who handles very personal information for their customers. They want to modernize 
their operations while making security their main priority.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
Running dependency checks was something that I did very well in this project. I was able to find all of the places where the software needed updating. It is important to code securely so that this information can not be hacked by someone on the outside, or even the inside. Software security adds peace of mind for the customers, while making my client a reputable company who protects their customers.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
At first, it was all very challenging and new to me, specifically, I struggled with generating the dependency report.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Something I did to increase layers of security is generating a self signed certificate. This made it so that only authorized personal who have the password, to be able to get access. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I had to run the code as well as the dependency check many times as I made adjustments. Using the Maven Dependency check was extremely helpful. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
A coding practice that I used that was helpful to me was writing my code a little at a time and running it in between.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would want to show future employees my self signed certificate as well as the dependency report that I ran.
